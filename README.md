# automaticbell
In the awake of the global pandemic of covid-19 there is a high demand of automated system in the market as this system are touchless and would
prevent the spread of deadly disease of covid-19.
Doorbell systems are systems that are widely used around the world and in the scenario of the pandemic it’s necessary that this system should be
automated .
Automatic/touchless doorbell system consist a list of components that make the system truly touchless , Components such as Arduino UNO, IR
sensor, Buzzer ,Led, Jumper wires, logic state, Power supply/source are used in the circuit .Firstly output of the IR sensor is given to 3 rd pin of Arduino
uno then led (red and green) are connected with 12/13 pin of Arduino Uno and both the Led’s are simultaneously connected to each other with one
connection to the buzzer used in the circuit. One end of buzzer is connected to the ground and other end to green led which represent the buzzer by
glowing while simulation , While IR sensor testpin is connected with logic state which can change its value while simulation and IR sensor isconnected with 
ground and 5v power supply to it’s respective pin.Codes of Arduino are installed in it by including the code Arduino file in it which is the hex file.
